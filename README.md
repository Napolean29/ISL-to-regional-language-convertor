In the realm of computer vision, dynamic two-
hand sign language identification in real-time from video-
based data is a difficult task. Weâ€™re working on an efficient
deep learning pipeline for real-time recognition of dynamic
two-hand gestures for low-power devices in this work. We
retrieved pose information in the form of 3D keypoints to
obtain a better discriminative representation of hands. We
further employ hand and pose features as input to proposed
TDLSTM model. We also share the method for creating the
corpus for the proposed THISL dataset. When compared
to GRU and LSTM+GRU, the developed recognition system
obtains a high recognition accuracy of 99.5% with an infer-
ence time of 0.2 seconds. In addition, the suggested pipeline
surpasses previous similar published literature work.
